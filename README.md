# Numerical instabilities in NGRC

This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the numerical simulations in the manuscript **"On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing"**.  
We study the conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix, exploring how hyperparameters influence the condition number and the NGRC dynamics. Our findings emphasize the need for careful hyperparameter tuning.
